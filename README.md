# Discord Bot

This is a bot I am working on as a side project. It uses the discord.py API (https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html#)

Notice: This code is for reading only. You will not be able to use this code without the token that discord assigns to all bots. 

This project is using Python 3.
